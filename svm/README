We use the LIBLINEAR software package to perform linear classification.

A complete reference can be found here:
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/

Notes:
-LIBLINEAR needs to be compiled before use.
-The compiled 'train' and 'predict' functions need to be included in your
   MATLAB path if they are not in your current working directory.
     -On the HOME tab, in the ENVIRONMENT section, click SET PATH.
     -Add the directory in which LIBLINEAR is installed.
-LIBLINEAR can take a variety of parameters as a string, to see a full
 list, you can either:
    -Type 'train' or 'predict' in the MATLAB interpreter
    -Consult the LIBLINEAR README in the matlab/ folder
